# Security Policy

The VA.gov team takes security issues in VA.gov seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly 
disclosure your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities. Which versions are eligible receiving such patches depend on the 
[CVSS v3.0](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0) Rating:

## Responsible disclosure security policy

A responsible disclosure policy helps protect users of the project from publicly disclosed security vulnerabilities 
without a fix by employing a process where vulnerabilities are first triaged in a private manner, and only publicly 
disclosed after a reasonable time period that allows patching the vulnerability and provides an upgrade path for users.

When contacting us directly via email, we will do our best efforts to respond in a reasonable time to resolve the issue. 

We kindly ask you to refrain from malicious acts that put our users, the project, or any of the projectâ€™s team members 
at risk.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a suspected security vulnerability, please report it to 
**[security@va.gov](mailto:security@va.gov)** and include the word "SECURITY" in the subject line. 
You will receive a response from us within 48 hours. If the issue is confirmed, we will release a 
patch as soon as possible depending on complexity but historically within a few days.
