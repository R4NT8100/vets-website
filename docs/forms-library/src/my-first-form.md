# My First Form

Welcome to the VA Forms Library! In this chapter, we'll create a simple form
application from the ground up and get it running on `vets-website`. We'll
introduce you to the application generator, the files it creates, the
`formConfig` that powers your form, and the `schema` and `uiSchema` that give it
substance.
