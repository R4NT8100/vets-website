Welcome to the VA Forms Library! In this chapter, we'll create a simple form application from the ground up and get it running on your local machine. Before we dive into actually building a form it will be helpful to give a bird's eye view of how our form system works.

### Form system concepts

Conceptually our form system is set up to help you build a form on VA.gov as quickly and painlessly as possible. In practice what this means is that you as the engineer building the form only need to fill out a configuration file and everything else in terms of building the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is all taken care of by the form system.  This can be a huge abstraction at first so let's explore this a little deeper. 

The work you do with the form system will center around the configuration file I mentioned earlier, this file is called `form.js`. This configuration file is mostly a JSON object that gets exported as the default from the file. This JSON object is where you tell the form system what your form is called, how many pages it has, what form fields are in each page, how each field is to be validated, basically everything about your form. This configuration file can become very large and very complicated so it is critical that we become very comfortable with it from the outset, otherwise things can get tricky later on.

In a moment we will run the Yeoman generator to build a form and a `form.js` file will be created for you, however let's look at what that file will contain so that we are familiar with it before we see it in action. The main areas of interest are a set of imports and a JSON object called `formConfig`, lets focus on this `formConfig` object for a moment, here is what it looks like and it contains lots of JSON -

```
const formConfig = {
  ...Lots of JSON
}

```

When we look at the JSON inside this `formConfig` object you will see many of the name/ value pairs you can use to configure your form, things like `submitUrl` and `trackingPrefix`. You will see that everything inside this is just JSON name/ value pairs, setting the values of these name/ value pairs is the main way you will configure your form. We will get into what each and all of these mean, and the ones you will see that are generated by the Yeoman generator are not all of the fields you can add, there are more.


We'll
introduce you to the application generator, the files it creates, the
`formConfig` that powers your form, and the `schema` and `uiSchema` that give it
substance.
