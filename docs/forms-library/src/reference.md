## What each reference section contains
The first section, [**Schema Types**](schema-types.md) contains—you guessed it—a
**list of available types** for your schema. You'll also find the **default
fields and widgets** used for each type as well as **alternative widgets**
designed for them.

[**Available `ui:field`s**](available-uifields.md) provides a list of all fields and
all `uiSchema` options they use.

Similarly, [**Available `ui:widget`s**](./available-uiwidgets.md) provides a list of
all widgets and all `uiSchema` options they use.

[**`formConfig` Options**](./formconfig-options.md) covers all the options available
at the root `formConfig` level, such as the `urlPrefix` and `submitUrl`.

[**Page Options**](./page-options.md) lists all options available for every page,
such as `schema`, `uiSchema`, and `arrayPath`.
