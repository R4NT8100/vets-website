# `formConfig`

### Overview

  Each form needs its own `formConfig` object held inside a `src/applications/{your form name}/config/form.js` file. This `formConfig` holds the top level name/ value pairs in JSON that are used to build your form the way you need it, things like what URL your form will submit to or if you want pre-fill enabled. Some of the name/ value pairs in this JSON object are simple strings, others can be objects themselves that contain JavaScript and even React components in some instances. When the form system runs it takes your `formConfig` object and uses it to build the HTML, CSS and JavaScript for your form. This HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is all automatically wired up to produce a working form.
