# Forms Library

This documentation is, as you might have guessed, for the forms library. It's
written in markdown files found in `src/`. The format used is
[`mdbook`](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook), but that will likely change
once we're ready for this to be put onto the documentation site.

To read this book, there are currently three options:
1. **Read it in markdown**
    - Head to [`src/SUMMARY.md`](src/SUMMARY.md) for the table of contents
1. **Read the HTML**
    - Serve the contents of `book/` locally with `http-serve` or similar
    - These HTML files are created from the markdown using `mdbook build`
1. **Use `mdbook`**
    - Go to [`mdbook`](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) for more information
      on how to install and use `mdbook`
